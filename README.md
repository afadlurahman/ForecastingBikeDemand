In this project, I prepared and integrated raw data from multiple sources to create clean, analysis-ready datasets, then developed forecasting models using Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict bike rental demand based on seasonal trends, time factors, and weather conditions. I evaluated model performance using RMSE and cross-validation to ensure predictive accuracy, utilizing tools such as RStudio and Python.
